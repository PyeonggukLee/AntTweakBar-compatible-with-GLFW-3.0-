AntTweakBar-compatible-with-GLFW-3.0-
=====================================

This project is for AntTweakBar to support GLFW 3.0+

I have modified the some part of AntTweakBar source code which is related with GLFW input handling.
I did not touch any core of AntTweakBar logic, so it will work well like pure GLFW.

I hope this is helpful for anyone :-)
and also I am happy to get anyone to contribute for this project!
